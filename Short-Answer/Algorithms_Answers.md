## Exercise I

a) O(n)
growth is an equal rate to the increasing input which is n.


b) O(nlogn)
it has two loops. 0(n^2)


c) O(n)
its looping thru it once and its a recursive function. 

## Exercise II

start at the first floor drop an egg
check if the egg broke or not 
then move to the next floor 
do the the same thing again 

     O(n) keeps running "eggs"
